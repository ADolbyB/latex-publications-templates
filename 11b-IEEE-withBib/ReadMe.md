# Note:

Part of This Collection of files was downloaded directly from the IEEE: [Manuscript Templates for Conference Proceedings](https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html). Here, I use the `LaTeX Bibliography Files` part of the IEEE Template.

This folder `11b-IEEE-withBib` uses the IEEE Conference template and Bibliography and has selected parts cut and pasted from `conference_101719.tex`. Here, I used `IEEE-JB.tex` to generate `IEEE-JB.pdf`, but the Bibliography is generated from `IEEEexample.bib` which uses the format `IEEEabrv.bib`.
 - Refer to this [Stack Exchange Question](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/514114/how-to-use-the-ieeetran-style-for-printbibliography) for helpful information.

I found it helpful to cut and paste certain pieces of the code from the previous `11a-IEEE-Conference` folder at a time and observe/manipulate the results.
