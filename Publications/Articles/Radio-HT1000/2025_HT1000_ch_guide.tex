    \item \section{General Information}
\end{center}

This is a general handheld radio primer that can be adapted to any radio \textit{band plan}.  
This plan happens to describe operation on the \textit{MURS} portion of the \textit{FCC Part 95} frequency
allocations, using surplus Motorola HT1000s, but can be adapted to any radio with any channel configuration, 
since the principles of operation are all the same. This manual was originally written for a client of the
author's located in SE Massachusetts, and is now being modified for release to this public repository.

\medskip
\noindent In this guide, the following nomenclature will be used:

\medskip
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Italics} are used for keywords or vocabulary that is important to learn.
    \item \textsc{Small Caps} refers to a unique work employment position or title.
    \item \textbf{Bold Face} is used for emphasis.
    \item The ``$\approx$'' symbol is used, precedes a number and means ``approximately''.
    \item The abbreviation ``Hz'' for Hertz is used, which is a measurement of frequency. Hz means ``cycles per second,'' 
        which is to say how many times a radio wave repeats itself per second. Also note:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item kHz = kilohertz: thousands of cycles per second.
            \item MHz = megahertz: millions of cycles per second.
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\medskip
This guide
focuses on some slightly advanced topics that the client was interested in, such as some theory and some higher
level operating procedures. Since the client had never had any radio experience before, this guide was a 
reinforcement of rules, regulations, types of operation, and what to do in case of a problem in the field,
as well as the author's view on what happens when the radios need service, etc. This in particular helped my client
be more confident in their own operating procedure, as well as provide a level of confidence in the author that
I am able to troubleshoot and repair any problems that may arise over time. This should also help understand 
various radio functions and help explain some useful, often overlooked features of the Motorola HT1000s. The 
actual manual that is screenshot on the next page is a free downloadable PDF that is available on 
\textit{The Internet Archive}. There is a link to this manual as well as a link to the Radio Service 
Software User's Manual placed in the ``Links'' section of this document. This guide is provided as a small bridge
between the knowledge gap that exists between newer radio users and the Motorola manuals.

    \item \subsection{MURS Frequency Allocation and Related Info}
\end{center}

These particular HT1000 radios operate in the MURS band in the \textit{VHF-Hi} portion of 
\textit{The Electromagnetic Spectrum}. MURS stands for ``Multi Use Radio Service'' and operates under the 
FCC Part 95 rules, which in this particular case is unlicensed spectrum, meaning no license is required to 
use it. This is unlike Amateur (ham) Radio, which operates under \textit{FCC Part 97} Rules, and has 5 
different license classes, 2 of which are \textit{legacy} only licenses.

\medskip
What is VHF-Hi Band? VHF is ``Very High Frequency'', which is considered to be
$30 - 300\text{ MHz}$ in frequency or $10\text{ meters} - 1\text{ meter}$ in wavelength. The
Hi or Lo designation splits the entire VHF band into $2$ parts. This split happens at 
$\approx 100\text{ MHz}$. So if your radio (or television) operates above  $\approx 100\text{ MHz}$ but 
below 300 MHz, then it operates in the VHF-Hi band. As a comparison, the FM radio in automobiles 
receives from 88 MHz to 108 MHz, so it operates at the upper edge of VHF-Lo band, and crosses into the 
lower edge of the VHF-Hi band. FCC Part 73 encompasses the rules for all broadcast services, including 
television and radio.

\medskip
For this particular client in SE Massachusetts, the VHF MURS band was chosen for these particular reasons:
\medskip
\begin{enumerate}
    \item MURS operation is license free, unlike other services in the VHF-Hi band.
    \item The client's location is rural with plenty of foliage. VHF-Hi band has superior coverage in this
        type of environment over higher frequency bands.
    \item VHF-Hi band is an excellent compromise between antenna length and terrain \\penetration, unlike lower
        frequency bands which require much larger antennas.
\end{enumerate}

\medskip
Something else to mention is that these HT1000 radios are \textit{FCC Part 90} certified for use in the
VHF-Hi band, which in the case of this bandsplit of Motorola HT1000s means they can operate from 
$ 136\text{ MHz} $ to $174\text{ MHz}$. Why? Because that is the allocated spectrum for anything operating 
under FCC Part 90 rules in the VHF-Hi band. Lower than 136 MHz is used for aircraft (FCC Part 87), and above
174 MHz is used for broadcast television. 

\medskip Also note why we are allowed to use an FCC Part 90 radio in the MURS band: the two sets of rules 
(Part 90 and Part 95) have overlap and the Part 90 operator implied license exceeds any license class in the entire 
FCC Part 95 regulations, given that we can operate within the FCC's frequency and bandwidth allocations.

\clearpage
% === Page 5 ========================================================================
\medskip
So what are the MURS frequency allocations? These \textit{channel allocations} are numbered and named by 
the FCC as follows:

\medskip
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Name: MURS 1.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Freq: $151.82\text{ MHz}$.
        \item Max \textit{Bandwidth}: $11.25\text{ MHz}$.
        \item Max Power: $2$ Watts \textit{ERP}.
    \end{itemize}

    \item Name: MURS 2.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Freq: $151.88\text{ MHz}$.
        \item Max \textit{Bandwidth}: $11.25\text{ MHz}$.
        \item Max Power: $2$ Watts \textit{ERP}.
    \end{itemize}

    \item Name: MURS 3
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Freq: $151.94\text{ MHz}$.
        \item Max \textit{Bandwidth}: $11.25\text{ MHz}$.
        \item Max Power: $2$ Watts \textit{ERP}.
    \end{itemize}

    \item Name: MURS 4 aka Blue Dot.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Freq: $154.57\text{ MHz}$.
        \item Max \textit{Bandwidth}: $20\text{ MHz}$.
        \item Max Power: $2$ Watts \textit{ERP}.
    \end{itemize}

    \item Name: MURS 5 aka Green Dot.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Freq: $154.60\text{ MHz}$.
        \item Max \textit{Bandwidth}: $20\text{ MHz}$.
        \item Max Power: $2$ Watts \textit{ERP}.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

This is the list the FCC issues as the guide for MURS channel allocation. These are the specifications, or ``rules''
that the FCC provides the public so the MURS channels are used legally and do not cause \textit{interference} 
on another channel or some other service that is not MURS. These FCC rules are also good for \textit{interoperability}
so that everyone who wants to use this MURS band uses the same settings so the audio coming out of the radio 
sounds correct, and all the radios are on the same frequencies.

The above linked guide is a free public download, but is a 170 page document. It is the factory service manual that an 
\textsc{RF Technician} or \textsc{RF Engineer} could refer to for ``fixing'' the Jedi Generation of handheld radios. 
It has all the part numbers and pictures for every piece the radio contains. The service manual also contains other 
important information just like this author used in his job as \textsc{Production Engineer} at an OEM in South Florida. 
Most of the information the author needed for his job was:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Printed Circuit Board Physical Layout.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item This is so the \textsc{Engineer} can trace the physical ``wiring'' (called traces) that travel 
            through the PCB.
        \item This is a good use of an \textit{ohmmeter}, to \textit{check continuity} from one place on the PCB to another.
        \item Checking continuity means expecting and measuring a 0 ohm \textit{short} reading on the ohmmeter from one 
            place to another place.
        \item The layouts are ``where everything is'' and what it looks like in real life, layer by layer, if 
            you held any of the radio components or sub-assembly components in your hand and looked at them. In today's
            subscription based services, like Altium Designer, each of these layers can be inspected on the computer
            screen and highlighted as needed for any circuit on the PCB.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Wiring and PCB Schematic diagrams.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item This is what the \textsc{Engineer} or \textsc{Technician} uses to identify electrical circuit \\configurations 
            in the radio for testing. If we know the circuit configuration, then we can conduct tests and voltage measurements
            with a ``good'' radio, then \\compare that result with a ``suspect'' or ``defective'' radio. This is a very effective
            method of testing if you have more than 1 of the same assembly. This client was given 4 HT1000s, so if one breaks,
            any radio repair facility can take one good unit and one broken unit, and use the service manual to locate and fix the
            root cause of the failure.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Other useful tools in the service manual this author would use:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item How to test the complete assembly, what measurements to take and how to \\measure them.
        \item Pictures and part numbers of proprietary test equipment and proprietary tools.
        \item Error Codes and how to retrieve, decode, and interpret them.
        \item How to ``align'' the radio. This is a periodic maintenance item and done after some repairs.
            Radio alignment adjusts the radio so that it conforms to the FCC channel specifications for operation.
        \item How to disassemble and reassemble the radio and everything inside it.
        \item Maintenance procedures, just like a car.
        \item Exploded parts views of the physical parts, what they look like, and their part numbers.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

This old service manual would usually be shipped printed in a 3-ring binder to the Motorola radio dealers in 
addition to being used by the internal Motorola Engineering team. Nowadays the engineers who write the manual 
just give us files to open in our subscription-based computer programs or subscription-based web tools that can be 
easily emailed to anyone needing it. In the next subsection there will be links and URLs to check out 
some of these Web Tools. They are very, very expensive but usually have free trials for a month or so.

    \section{Channel Groups and Information}    
\end{center}

What is considered a ``Channel Group?'' In this particular use case with this client's HT1000s, channels $1 - 5$ 
are considered a group by the author because these channels all have one thing in common: the \textit{PL Tone}. 
Channel Group $1$ has the functionality of channel interoperability using a \textit{tone squelch} 
of $103.5$ Hz while more than one radio is tuned to the same HT1000 channel. This feature blocks all other stations
or interference from another station that is not using the same $103.5$ Hz tone on their transmitter.
Later on, other commonalities of each group will be explained as they appear.

\begin{center}
    \item \subsection{Channel Group 1: Channels 1 - 5}

        \item Tone: 103.5 Hz
        \item Bandwidth: Narrow (11.25 kHz)
    \end{itemize}
    \item MURS 2
     \begin{itemize}
        \item Freq: 151.880 MHz
        \item Tone: 103.5 Hz
        \item Bandwidth: Narrow (11.25 kHz)

\end{enumerate}

\clearpage
% === Page 9 ========================================================================
\begin{center}
    \item \subsection{Channel Group 2: Channels 6 - 11}    
\end{center}

\medskip
\begin{enumerate}[resume]
    \item MURS 1
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Freq: 151.820 MHz
        \item Tone: 127.3 Hz
        \item Bandwidth: Narrow (11.25 kHz)

        \item Tone: 127.3 Hz
        \item Bandwidth: Wide (20 kHz)
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\medskip
Note that all of these have the same tone of $127.3$ Hz, so they are considered a channel group.
Channel 11 is slightly different than the rest of the channels in Group 2, although it should be 
interoperable with any of the HT1000s that are tuned to channel 10 or 11. We will discuss that next.

\clearpage    
% === Page 10 ======================================================================== 
\medskip
The ``special'' channel 11 is exactly the same as channel 10, except at the end of every transmission on 
channel 11, there is a unique ``chirp'' noise that can be heard by the receiving radio. While listening, after 
the voice audio stops, the radio sends out a little data burst packet which is what many Police Departments 
(Plymouth PD verified by this author, Falmouth PD verified by author's brother-in-law) used for ``unit ID.'' 
This data burst is decoded by the dispatch console and used typically by the dispatcher when one of the 
officers (or firefighters or EMS, etc.) calls out on the radio. The dispatcher knows immediately who is 
calling to keep transmissions shorter and help keep the channel clear of traffic. Each officer in a squad 
car will usually have two radios: one handheld, and one mobile unit mounted in the vehicle. Each radio can 
have its own unique ID, so the dispatcher knows if the officer is calling from the handheld or the squad car.

This ``chirp'' tone is named: \textit{MDC-1200}, and is set to ID on \textit{dekey}. For it to work properly,
the radio must be \textit{keyed up} for $\approx$ one second.

\begin{enumerate}[resume]
    \item MURS 5 with MDC1200 ID on dekey.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Freq: 154.60 MHz

\end{center}

In Channel Group 3, all channels are set to receive (RX) only. Transmitting on these
channels is not allowed in this case due to the missing \textit{FCC Part 80} type certification on the HT1000 
radios, which is needed for transmitting on the Marine VHF band. Transmitting on the NOAA Weather Band is also 
not allowed because the beacon is a \textit{broadcast station}.

In the area of SE Massachusetts, the NOAA Ch 1 weather beacon is in the Boston area at the Blue Hills

                    \end{itemize}
                        \begin{itemize}
                            \item USCG calls out on channel $16$ for the announcement, then switches to channel $22A$ 
                            to make the announcement.
                        \end{itemize}
                        \item When tuned to any Marine Channel on these Radios, the toggle switch can be switched to 
                            ``C'' and the radio will scan all $3$ channels continuously until switched off of position 
                            ``C'', or if the channel is switched to another channel group.
                \end{itemize}
        \item Group C: Both local NOAA Weather Radio stations.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Scan is deactivated on the $2$ NOAA Weather channels. This is because they are 
                    \textit{broadcast stations}, so they are continually transmitting and would not let the radio scan.
            \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\medskip
Note that the Toggle Switch Configuration can be changed in the RSS (MS-DOS based). The only other useful
function we might care about is changing the Toggle Switch Configuration to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A: When the radio receives a signal, 2 conditions must be met to \textit{unsquelch} the radio.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Sets the radio to sense an \textit{FM carrier} signal AND the PL Tone to unsquelch.
    \end{itemize}
    \item B: When the radio receives a signal, it only needs to hear the FM carrier to unsquelch.
    \item C: Channel scan function just like on these radios.
\end{itemize}

% === Page 13 ========================================================================
\medskip
All the other Toggle Switch functions in the RSS are mostly useless now since they are legacy configurations 
related to obsolete and outdated \textit{Trunking Protocols}. The other configurations can be viewed in the Radio
Service Software manual. The link for that manual is in Section 5 of this document. The side button configuration
menu can be viewed on page 88 of the RSS manual if interested.

\medskip
\noindent Side and Top Button Definitions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Side Button $1$: Top round button on the side of the radio.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Function: Inoperative/Disabled.
        \item This function CAN be changed in RSS.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Side Button $2$: Second from top button on the side of the radio.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Function: Inoperative/Disabled.
        \item This function CAN be changed in RSS.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Side Button $3$: Third from top button on the side of the radio.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Function: Monitor
        \item When pressing this button momentarily, the radio will unsquelch and noise can heard on an unused channel.
            Holding the button for more than $5$ seconds will result in the permanent unsquelching of the radio on that
            channel until the button is pressed again, or the radio is switched off and on again.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item This function is very handy for detecting weak stations that can be heard, but are too weak to
                    unsquelch the radio. Sometimes when just out of range of another station, the radio will not 
                    unsquelch, but pressing the monitor button may allow the operator to hear the weak station through
                    the noise.
            \end{itemize}
        \item This function CAN be changed in RSS.
    \end{itemize}
        \item Side Button $4$: Long bumpy oval button on the side of the radio.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Push To Talk or ``PTT'' button.
            \item Function CANNOT be changed in RSS. This must always function as the PTT buttton.
        \end{itemize}
    \item Top Orange Button: Top of radio near antenna.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Function: Inoperative/Disabled.
        \item This function CAN be changed in RSS.
        \item This function is typically used for an ``Emergency'' or ``Panic'' button on old trunking networks which are
            all legacy and obsolete now, so it typically goes unused. In newer radios with a display, the orange
            button can typically be \\ configured to light the display or toggle the high and low power setting in the 
            RSS. The ``Emergency'' function is only usable on trunking networks, otherwise it just creates 
            interference.

\end{center}

In this guide, some different services in the VHF-Hi band for the range of 136 MHz - 174 MHz were discussed,
since that is the frequency range of operation for the HT1000s.
In that band, there are many different services, some which were not discussed:

\medskip
\begin{itemize}
    \item Amateur Radio: 144 - 148 MHz (FCC Part 97.)
    \item MURS band: 151 MHz and 154 MHz (FCC Part 95.)
    \item Marine VHF band: 155 MHz - 161 MHz (FCC Part 80.)
    \item Railroad VHF: 160 MHz - 161 MHz (Also FCC Part 90.)
    \item NOAA Weather Radio: 162 MHz (FCC Part 11 for Emergency Alert Systems.)
\end{itemize}

\medskip
Railroad VHF used to be conventional analog operation, but has mostly moved to digital operation, so the 
HT1000 would only hear the digital tones and not decode it properly for listening to voice traffic. To decode
digital voice traffic, a newer digital radio with a digital vocoder is required.

\begin{center}
    \item \subsection{Page 3 Definitions}
\end{center}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textit{band plan}: A radio band plan (also called a frequency allocation plan or spectrum allocation 
        plan) is a structured framework that divides portions of the radio frequency spectrum into specific frequency 
        bands and assigns each band to particular services, users, or types of radio communications. It ensures orderly, 
        efficient, and interference-free use of the limited radio spectrum resource. Some other examples are as follows:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item US FM Radio Broadcast Band Plan: 87.5 - 108 MHz.
        \item US 700 MHz Cellular Band Plan: 698 - 806 MHz.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textit{MURS}: Multi Use Radio Service. The FCC channel allocations for operating here can be 
        seen on page 3.
    \item \textit{FCC}: The Federal Communications Commission. This is the US Executive Branch agency that
        was created in the 1930s which provides the regulatory framework for frequency/channel allocations in the
        in the USA for ALL services. TV, radio, satellite, aircraft, ships, boats, everything. There are all 
        different ``FCC Part'' numbers for each different service.
    \item \textit{FCC Part 95}: This is the frequency allocations for Personal Radio Services (PRS). Part 95 
        includes MURS (license free), FRS (Family Radio Service, also license free), GMRS (General Mobile Radio 
        Service, requires a license and overlaps with FRS), and CB (Citizens Band, also license free).
    \item \textit{The Internet Archive}: This is a public archive of various materials available to anyone on 
        the internet for free. This archive has free books, manuals, games, and all kinds of other software.
    \item \textit{VHF}: Very High Frequency band. The entire band spans from 30 MHz to 300 MHz in frequency or
        10 meters to 1 meter in wavelength.
    \item \textit{VHF-Hi}: This is the portion of the VHF band from 100 MHz to 300 MHz, or 3 meters to 1 meter in
        wavelength.
    \item \textit{VHF-Lo}: This is the portion of the VHF band from 30 MHz to 100 MHz, or 10 meters to 3 meters
        in wavelength.
    \item \textit{UHF}: Ultra High Frequency band. The ``next highest'' band in frequency above VHF. UHF spans
        from 300 MHz to 3 GHz in frequency, or 1 meter to 10 centimeters in wavelength.

% === Page 17 ========================================================================    
    \item \textit{The Electromagnetic Spectrum}: This is the entire spectrum of frequencies in the universe. It
        spans from Radiofrequency Waves (RF) at the lower end (several MHz), then to Microwaves (several GHz). 
        In the center of the Electromagnetic Spectrum is Visible Light. Just below Visible Light is called Infrared, 
        which is a type of light we can't see (but the camera on your cellphone can!!). Lots of TV remotes use infrared 
        to control the TV, and night vision cameras use infrared to create that bright black and white night vision
        picture.
        Just above visible light are Ultraviolet rays or UV Light, which we also can't see. At the very high
        end of the Electromagnetic Spectrum are: X-rays, then Gamma Rays, and finally Cosmic Rays are the highest
        known frequency that exists in the Universe. All of these have something in common: they are all particles
        and/or waves that can travel through free space (around the universe in space). Their only difference 
        is frequency. Sound waves are NOT in the Electromagnetic Spectrum because they do not travel through free 
        space, and cannot take the form of a particle. Sound is considered a ``mechanical wave'' created by the 
        motion of a speaker, and is therefore not part of the Electromagnetic Spectrum. Mechanical Waves are still 
        waves, though, so they can still be measured in Hertz or Kilohertz. Compared to the frequency of Radio Waves,
        sound waves are MUCH lower in frequency.
    \item \textit{FCC Part 97}: This is the rules of operation and frequency allocations for the Amateur Radio 
        (ham) Band.
    \item \textit{legacy}: This word refers to any software, hardware, license or etc. that is outdated and no
        longer used. Something that is considered ``obsolete'' is also considered a ``legacy item'' just like old
        Nintendo NES games from the 1980s.

\begin{center}
    \item \subsection{Page 4 Definitions}
\end{center}

    \item \textit{FCC Part 90}: This is the FCC allocation for ``Private Land Mobile Radio Service'' aka PLMR and
        covers licensed operation for services like: Police, Fire, City, County, Private Contractors, Crane Companies,
        and etc. that want to use high power radios. This is also the class certification for the HT1000 radios. They
        are ``FCC Part 90 Type Accepted'' for this type of use.
    \item \textit{channel allocation}: a channel allocation or frequency allocation is a specification that the
        FCC provides to operate in a certain radio service. This allocation will include specs like: maximum power
        for that channel, the channel bandwidth, and the frequency of the channel.
    \item \textit{Bandwidth}: Bandwidth is how much spectrum the radio uses on a specific channel. The FCC
        defines maximum bandwidth on MURS as either $ 11.25 \text{ kHz} $ for MURS 1, 2 and 3, or $ 20 \text{ kHz} $
        for MURS 4 and 5. Even though the radio is tuned to MURS 1, for example, at $ 151.82 \text{ MHz} $, the
        radio needs to use a little spectrum on either side of that ``center frequency'' to send the voice traffic.
        Think of the FCC allocated ``max bandwidth'' as the total width of a lane on the road. In order to drive
        down the center of that lane, the car must be less wide than the lane, or the vehicle would not fit the lane,
        and you couldn't drive it on the road without interfering with oncoming traffic. It is the same principle in a
        radio transmitter. We must set the radio to transmit within its own ``lane'' so that it does not interfere 
        with other radio traffic on adjacent channels. The bandwith setting in the radio firmware (modified 
        via \textit{RSS}) must be set properly. The RSS has predetermined settings for channel bandwidth.
% === Page 18 ========================================================================
    \item \textit{RSS}: The Motorola trademark for ``Radio Service Software,'' which is the program used to 
        modify programmed radio data such as: operating frequency, PL tone, toggle switch configurations, and etc.
    \item \textit{ERP}: ERP stands for Effective Radiated Power. This value referes to how many watts of RF 
        power the antenna is actually radiating from the antenna, which includes the total output power of the
        radio, minus transmission line losses, plus antenna gain (or loss). This value, in the case of the HT1000
        would be at least 5 watts on high power, which is the transmitter output rating. The transmission line 
        losses are nearly negligible since the antenna is directly connected to the radio. So the only factors that
        affect ERP on the HT1000 is: the power switch (low vs high power) and the antenna gain, measured in 
        decibels (dB.)
    \item \textit{interference}: According to the FCC, interference is defined as: ``The effect of unwanted energy 
        due to one or a combination of emissions, radiations, or inductions upon reception in a radiocommunication 
        system, manifested by any performance degradation, misinterpretation, or loss of information which could be 
        extracted in the absence of such unwanted energy.'' What does all that mean? Interference is any unwanted
        RF energy that affects signal reception. Interference can be accidentally caused by LED or fluorescent 
        lights, or can be deliberate (and illegal) from another radio operator trying to ``jam'' your signal so the
        receiving radio gets no signal or a degraded signal.
    \item \textit{interoperability}: This term refers to different radios, usually carried by different \\ 
        departments, which allow them to communicate beyond just their own dispatch unit. As an example: police, 
        fire and EMS could be on separate frequencies with separate dispatchers. However, each police, fire, 
        and/or EMS unit radio will have \\ ``interoperability channels'' so they can talk to each other for whatever 
        reason when they need to, like if they were attending the same call. This goes up level by level typically, 
        where those same local units can have interoperability channels with neighboring local agencies or state 
        agencies, and state agencies usually have interoperability channels with federal agencies in case more than 
        one agency is responding to a call.

\begin{center}
    \item \subsection{Page 5 Definitions}
\end{center}

    \item \textit{Jedi Series}: The Motorola Jedi Series is a generation of radios that were in use in the 1990s
        throughout the 2010s or so. They were preceded by the Motorola ``Genesis Series'' (models like P200s and HT600s), 
        and proceeded by the ''Astro'' series (Astro Spectras and XTS3000s), and then replaced by the ``Astro25''
        series of radios (XTS and XTL 5000s).

\begin{center}
    \item \subsection{Page 6 Definitions}
\end{center}

    \item \textit{Ohmmeter}: An ohmmeter is a device that measures ``resistance'' in Ohms ($ \Omega $).
        Resistance is a value that states how difficult it is for electricity to flow. Low ohms is easier for 
        electricity to flow, higher resistance is more difficult for electricity to flow.
    \item \textit{continuity check}: Performing a ``continuity check'' uses an ohmmeter. To do this, the circuit
        must be powered off, and having good continuity means having the lowest ohm value possible, like if we
        were measuring the continuity of a wire from the front of a vehicle to the rear.
    \item \textit{short or short circuit}: a short, or short circuit refers to a $ 0 \Omega $ value. This can
        be good or bad. It is bad to short any power source from positive directly to negative, like a car battery.
        This is dangerous, and causes sparks and can cause a fire. In the case of a single wire, we would expect 
        a $ 0 \Omega $ short from one end of the wire to the other, since it needs to deliver the power to some
        load or consumer (like the transmitter or a light bulb) with the least resistance possible.

\begin{center}
    \item \subsection{Page 7 Definitions}
\end{center}
    
    \item \textit{embedded computer systems}: An ``embedded computer system'' or ``embedded system'' is a system 
        that is dedicated to perform certain functions and do not typically have normal Graphical User Interfaces like 
        a laptop or a desktop computer. Some common examples of embedded computer systems are: an ATM machine, a 
        microwave, the computer system that runs the internal combustion engine in a car, or the entertainment system 
        in the vehicle. All these systems have the same thing in common: they all have dedicated purposes and no access 
        to the internal file system like a ``general use'' computer (laptop, desktop, etc.) The HT1000s are also 
        considered an embedded system.

% === Page 20 ========================================================================
\begin{center}
    \item \subsection{Page 8 Definitions}
\end{center}

    \item \textit{PL Tone}: ``PL'' is the Motorola trademark that means ``Private Line.'' This is somewhat of
        a misnomer, since there is no privacy guaranteed on the public airwaves. The following terms are functionally
        equivalent: PL Tone, Tone, and PL. Use whichever interchangeably. it just means the radio is also 
        transmitting an analog tone in addition to the voice traffic.
    \item \textit{tone squelch}: ``tone squelch'' is a setting on the radio that only allows the radio to unmute
        or ``unsquelch'' when it receives: 1) A carrier signal on the correct frequency and 2) the correct PL Tone. 
        This is different than the ``carrier squelch'' setting, which only requires a carrier signal on the correct 
        frequency to unmute the radio. There is another setting called ``DCS'' or ``Digital Coded Squelch'' which 
        functions equivalently to the tone squelch function, except instead of analog PL tones, it uses digital codes.
        Motorola uses its own trademarked name for DCS called ``DPL'' which means ``Digital Private Line,'' another
        misnomer, but functions equivalently to DCS.

\begin{center}
    \item \subsection{Page 10 Definitions}
\end{center}

    \item \textit{MDC-1200}: Officially named ``Motorola Data Communications 1200 \textit{baud}.'' This is one of 
        many forms of Automatic Number ID (ANI) that is used for unit identification. This MDC-1200 data burst is 16 
        bits of information, contained in four \textit{hexadecimal} digits. The range of this ID number is 
        $0000 - FFFF$. To calculate the total number of unique IDs available, we use the following formula:
        $$ 2^{\text{ }\# \text{ of bits}} = 2^{16} = 65536 \text{ total IDs.} $$
    \item \textit{baud}: ``baud'', also called ``baud rate'' just refers to how many binary bits (1s and 0s)
        are sent every second. $$ 1200 \text{ baud} = 1200 \text{ bits per second. VERY slow by todays standards.} $$
    \item \textit{hexadecimal}: Also called ``hex'' for shorthand, this is a numbering system using 16 digits 
        $0 - 9$ and letters A - F. So in order to count in hex, we go like this:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F, 10.
        \item 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 1A, 1B, 1C, 1D, 1E, 1F, 20, and so on.
        \item Hex is just a convenient way to convert ``binary'' (1s and 0s) to something more human readable
        using numbers and a few letters.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textit{dekey}: ``dekey'' refers to when the radio operator ``unkeys'' the radio, which means the
        operator releases the Push To Talk (PTT) button. Releasing the PTT button means the radio is not transmitting
        and is in receive mode.
% === Page 21 ========================================================================    
    \item \textit{keyed up}: A radio is ``keyed up'' when the PTT button is pressed. This puts the radio in
        transmit mode so the radio operator can talk over the air. This can also be referred to as the ``keyup'' 
        state of the radio, which is terminology referred to in the service manual.

\begin{center}
    \item \subsection{Page 11 Definitions}
\end{center}

\item \textit{FCC Part 80}: The FCC set of rules that regulate marine, ship, and boater communications.
\item \textit{broadcast station}: A station or beacon that is always transmitting, like the NOAA weather stations
    or over the air (OTA) television stations.
\item \textit{RX Only}: A channel that is ``listen only.'' These channels on a radio are set to only receive and 
    cannot transmit.
\item \textit{carrier squelch}: When the radio is not receiving any traffic, it remains muted or ``squelched'' so 
    the operator does not hear the static noise that would be present on an empty channel. A radio set to receive
    in ``carrier squelch'' mode will unmute for any signal that increases above the squelch level, including noise
    and interference as long as it exceeds the squelch level. Why would this be desired? In the case of ham radio,
    most of the author's radios are set to receive in carrier squelch mode so that ANY station calling in with any
    PL tone or DCS code can be heard. Unfortunately, the disadvantage is receiving noise once in awhile.

\begin{center}
    \item \subsection{Page 12 Definitions}
\end{center}

\item \textit{unsquelch}: When a radio is turned on, tuned to any channel, but not receiving a signal, no noise
    can be heard from the radio. This is the ``squelched'' state of the radio, so background static noise is
    not heard on an unused channel. When the radio receives voice traffic, it ``unsquelches'' or unmutes so 
    the audio can be heard from the speaker. As soon as the signal disappears, the radio returns to the squelched
    state.
\item \textit{FM carrier}: FM stands for ``Frequency Modulation,'' which is the mode of transmission the radio uses
    to transmit information (voice traffic) over the air. The FM Carrier is the signal that the receiving radio
    can detect so it can then unmute and the operator can listen to the voice traffic coming over the air. There are 
    two components to the radio transmission: the FM Carrier, which does not change and is used by the receiving radio
    to detect a signal, and the ``baseband,'' which is the actual voice traffic being sent over the air using the FM
    carrier. There are other modes of transmission, one of which may be familiar is AM, or ``Amplitude 
    Modulation'' which is a slightly different mode. Explaining these modes is beyond the scope of this document, 
    but can easily be researched on the internet.

% === Page 22 ========================================================================   
\begin{center}
    \item \subsection{Page 13 Definitions}
\end{center}

\item \textit{Trunking Protocols}: Trunking protocols are standardized rules and procedures that govern 
    how trunked radio systems (also known as trunked Land Mobile Radio or LMR systems) automatically manage 
    and allocate a shared pool of radio frequency channels among multiple users or groups in two-way radio 
    communications. This is a common practice for public safety systems like Police, Fire, and EMS. In 
    conventional analog radio systems, such as MURS operation, each group of channels is assigned 
    a fixed, dedicated channel, which can lead to inefficiencies if the channel is idle or very busy and
    overloaded. Trunking uses a computer-controlled central system to dynamically assign available channels 
    on demand. This allows a large number of users, often far more than the actual number of physical 
    channels, to share the same limited spectrum efficiently, based on the statistical principle that not 
    all users transmit simultaneously. A trunking system can help public safety because it can prioritize
    traffic, like if the emergency button is pressed, and can help guarantee that any operator who needs a
    clear channel has one when needed. Amateur Radio does not use trunking, since it requires expensive and 
    unneccessary extra hardware, which is not needed for normal use. Non-trunked systems are considered 
    ``conventional systems'', such as using the HT1000s in the MURS band.
