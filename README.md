# LaTeX Template Docs

This is a small collection of LaTeX templates I began creating and customizing from tutorials and content I found on the web.

I plan to learn documentation using LaTeX and migrate from word processing software (currently I use LibreOffice) to LaTeX for larger works.

## Environment:

 - Visual Studio Code
 - [LaTeX Workshop Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=James-Yu.latex-workshop)
 - [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/download) For Automatic Package Management.

## Sources:

 - In Progress
