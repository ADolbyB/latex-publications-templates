# LaTeX Template Docs

This is a small collection of LaTeX templates I began creating and customizing from tutorials and content I found on the web.

I plan to learn documentation using LaTeX and migrate from word processing software (currently I use LibreOffice) to LaTeX for larger works.

## Environment:

For Local Installations:
1. VS Code
    - Visual Studio Code
    - [LaTeX Workshop Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=James-Yu.latex-workshop)
    - [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/download) For Automatic Package Management.
2. TeXMaker
    - [TeXMaker](https://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/download.html): If you rather prefer a dedicated application for managing documents, check out this free cross-platform editor.
    - Note that Using TeXMaker still requires MiKTeX.

Online IDE:

3. Overleaf: 
    - [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) Online LaTeX Editor, which also has collaborative capabilities.
