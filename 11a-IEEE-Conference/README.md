# Note:

This Collection of files was downloaded directly from the IEEE: [Manuscript Templates for Conference Proceedings](https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html)

The file `conference_101719.tex` will compile into the `conference_101719.pdf` with no modification straight from IEEE, but without a bibliography, but you may need additional packages (Which is why I use MiKTeX).

The next folder `11b-IEEE-withBib` will be the same Conference template, but with a proper Bibliography.
 - Refer to `IEEEtran_HOWTO.pdf` for template instructions.

The folder `11c-IEEE-Complete` will be my own edited version I can use as a template w/ Bibliography.
 - Refer to `IEEEtran_bst_HOWTO.pdf` for template instructions.
